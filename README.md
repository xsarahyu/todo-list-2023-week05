### Description
- This to-do list allows users to:
  - Add new tasks (users are prevented from adding empty tasks)
  - Mark completed tasks
  - Clear completed tasks
  - Clear all tasks
- Data is saved to the local browser storage, so users can refresh or close the browser, reopen the to-do list, and still have the same information available.
